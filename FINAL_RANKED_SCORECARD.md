|------|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **#3 NoFap / Quit Porn** | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | **19** | 1.2M Reddit members, explosive TikTok, QUITTR proved $250K/mo. Very few competitors. |
| 2 | **#12 Quit Vaping** | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | **16** | Only 3% of vaping apps are quit-focused. Gen Z audience. Existing apps are repurposed smoking apps. |
| 3 | **#6 Intermittent Fasting** | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | **18** | 910K Reddit, huge search volume. Top apps (Simple, DoFasting) are hated as billing scams. Trust gap. |
| 4 | **#11 Quit Weed** | 2 | 5 | 3 | 5 | **15** | r/leaves 300K+, no dominant app, only Grounded (glitchy). Cannabis legalization = growing market. |
| 5 | **#26 No Sugar** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **14** | Top quit-sugar app has 11 reviews. Entire niche is empty. #NoSugarChallenge viral on TikTok. |
| 6 | **#10 Quit Caffeine** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **14** | Virtually NO dedicated app. Active TikTok community. Millions try to quit caffeine yearly. |
| 7 | **#16 Testosterone Tracker** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **14** | $1B+ adjacent market, Huberman effect, no category leader. Highly monetizable male demo. |
| 8 | **#27 Cold Plunge Tracker** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **14** | $390M hardware market, no software companion. 70% YoY search growth. Only Wim Hof app exists. |
| 9 | **#2 Quit Drinking / Sobriety** | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | **16** | r/stopdrinking 600K. Strong demand but I Am Sober is established. Need clear differentiator. |
| 10 | **#1 Quit Smoking** | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **14** | Proven market ($1.5B), strong Jan spikes. But Smoke Free and QuitNow are decent competitors. |
| 11 | **#9 Screen Time / Phone Addiction** | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **13** | Opal hit $10M ARR. Demand is real but Opal/one sec are solid competitors. |
| 12 | **#22 Mood Tracker** | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | **13** | TikTok favors mental health content. Daylio is the incumbent but subscription-fatigued users want simpler. |
| 13 | **#28 Reading Tracker** | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | **15** | BookTok is 200B+ views. Goodreads universally hated. But Storygraph exists. |
| 14 | **#8 Night Routine** | 2 | 2 | 4 | 5 | **13** | Virtually no dedicated app. Sleep apps focus on meditation, not structured routines. Niche but open. |
| 15 | **#17 Focus / Deep Work Timer** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | **14** | Strong search demand. Forest, Bear Focus exist but the "deep work hours logged" angle is underserved. |
| 16 | **#18 Study Timer** | 3 | 3 | 5 | 3 | **14** | StudyTok is 45B+ views. Several apps exist but most are bloated. |
| 17 | **#14 Affirmations / Gratitude** | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | **15** | Manifestation TikTok is 62B+ views. Motivation quotes app makes $700K/mo. Crowded but proven money. |
| 18 | **#4 Habit Streak / Discipline** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **13** | High demand but Streaks, Habitica, Fabulous are strong. Need very specific angle to differentiate. |
| 19 | **#7 Morning Routine** | 3 | 2 | 5 | 3 | **13** | 34B TikTok views but routine apps haven't taken off as a category. Risky. |
| 20 | **#23 Anti-Procrastination** | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **12** | Real pain point, some TikTok traction. Few dedicated apps. Small but passionate audience. |
| 21 | **#19 Weight Tracker** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **13** | Happy Scale is the clear winner. Hard to unseat. Saturated. |
| 22 | **#20 Social Media Detox** | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **12** | Growing demand but ironic paradox (marketing on the platforms you're quitting). |
| 23 | **#24 Daily Motivation** | 3 | 2 | 5 | 2 | **12** | $700K/mo quotes app proves demand. But category is flooded with low-quality clones. |
| 24 | **#5 Spending Tracker** | 5 | 3 | 4 | 1 | **13** | Massive search volume but YNAB ($49M ARR), Monarch, PocketGuard dominate. Avoid. |
| 25 | **#15 Calorie / Protein Tracker** | 5 | 5 | 4 | 2 | **16** | MyFitnessPal backlash is real but MacroFactor, Cronometer stepping in. Crowded. |
| 26 | **#25 Water Tracker** | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | **10** | Novelty wears off fast. Low retention. Multiple existing apps. |
| 27 | **#29 Meal Prep** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **13** | Mealime, Prepear exist. Needs recipe database = more complex build. |
| 28 | **#21 Workout Logger** | 5 | 4 | 5 | 1 | **15** | Huge market but Strong, Hevy dominate with $1M+/mo combined. Red ocean. |
| 29 | **#13 Pregnancy Tracker** | 5 | 3 | 5 | 1 | **14** | Flo Health dominates. VC-funded competitors. Not an indie fight. |
| 30 | **#30 Life Score / Rate Day** | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 | **8** | No demand. No community. Open but nobody's looking for this. |
