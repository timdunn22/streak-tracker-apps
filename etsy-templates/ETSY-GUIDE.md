# Etsy Spreadsheet Template Selling Guide

## Key Takeaways

### Pricing
- **$7.99-$12.99** for individual templates (sweet spot)
- **$19.99-$29.99** for bundles
- Never price below $5 — signals low quality
- Higher price per unit massively outperforms race-to-bottom ($112K vs $22K revenue)

### SEO
- **First 40 characters** of title are most critical (mobile cutoff)
- Use ALL 13 tags — each should be 2-5 word phrases
- Title structure: `[Primary Keyword], [Secondary Keyword], [Format], [Use Case]`
- Example: "Budget Spreadsheet Budget Planner Google Sheets Monthly Budget Tracker Excel Template Personal Finance"
- Descriptions now influence ranking through semantic search

### Images
- Use all 8 image slots + 15-second video
- Image 1: Laptop mockup with clean background, readable text
- Image 2-7: Tab overview, dashboard close-up, features, "What's Included", walkthrough
- Create in Canva at 2700x2025px minimum
- Video auto-plays on mobile = higher engagement

### Delivery Format
- Provide BOTH Google Sheets (force-copy link in PDF) AND .xlsx file
- Google Sheets link: change `/edit` to `/copy` in URL
- Always include instruction PDF
- Test-purchase your own listing

### Launch Strategy
- Start with 10-15 listings minimum
- Etsy gives new listings a temporary boost (hours to days)
- Takes 2-4 weeks to appear consistently in search
- 60-90 days for algorithm to fully evaluate ranking
- Need 100+ listings for significant traffic

### Common Failures to Avoid
1. No instructions (= bad reviews)
2. Pricing too low
3. Not building separate Google Sheets AND Excel versions
4. Too complex / feature overload
5. Giving up before 20 listings
6. Not testing download experience

### Fees
- $0.20 listing fee
- 6.5% transaction fee
- 3% + $0.25 payment processing
- **Total: ~10-12% of each sale**
