FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------

Q: What is the difference between Snowball and Avalanche?

Q: Does this work with Google Sheets?
A: Yes! Upload the .xlsx file to Google Drive and open with Google Sheets. All formulas transfer. The file may take a few extra seconds to calculate in Sheets due to the 120-month schedules.

Q: Can I add more debts later?
A: Yes. The template supports up to 20 debts. Simply add new debts to empty rows on the "Debt Input" sheet and the plans will update automatically.

Q: What if I don't have any extra money to put toward debt?
A: Enter $0 as your extra payment. The calculator will still show you how long it takes to pay off everything with just minimum payments. Then, as your situation improves, increase the extra payment and watch your timeline shrink.

## TEMPLATE 3: Subscription Tracker

### TITLE (140 chars max)

```
Subscription Tracker Spreadsheet Excel Google Sheets Template Recurring Expense Manager Membership Tracker Monthly Bill Organizer Dashboard
```

### TAGS (13 tags)

1. subscription tracker spreadsheet
2. recurring expense tracker
3. membership tracker template
4. monthly subscription manager
5. bill organizer spreadsheet
6. subscription budget planner
7. google sheets subscription tracker
8. excel subscription template
9. cancellation savings tracker
10. renewal calendar spreadsheet
11. expense dashboard template
12. financial organizer spreadsheet
13. subscription audit template

### PRICE

**$8.99**

Rationale: Slightly lower than the other two templates because subscription trackers are a newer, less-established category on Etsy with fewer direct competitors. The 6-sheet structure with dashboard, 100-slot capacity, renewal calendar, and cancellation log delivers strong value at $8.99 while encouraging bundle purchases. The slightly lower price point also appeals to impulse buyers who may not have searched for this type of template specifically.

### DESCRIPTION

```
FIND YOUR HIDDEN SUBSCRIPTIONS AND STOP WASTING MONEY

The average person has 12 active subscriptions and wastes $30-$100 per month on services they have forgotten about or barely use.

   - Shows both monthly and annual savings with custom formatting ($X.XX/mo, $X.XX/yr)
   - Auto-filter enabled for reviewing your cancellation history

Q: Does this work with Google Sheets?

A: The template uses dollar formatting by default, but you can easily change the currency format in Excel or Google Sheets. The formulas work the same regardless of currency.
