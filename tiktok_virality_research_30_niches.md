- Recovery advocacy represents 33.9% of all substance-related TikTok videos
- Combined: ~200-500M views (heavily suppressed by algorithm)

**Active Creator Community:** YES - Small but passionate. Creators like Phil Stille, Michael J Sutcliffe share quit journeys. Recovery-focused hashtags (#addiction, #recovery, #sober) serve as bridge communities. TikTok heavily moderates cannabis content.

**Existing Apps Promoted:** Grounded (quit weed app), Quitzilla, general sobriety counters. Very limited promotion.

---

**Virality Rating: STRONG**
- Universally relatable topic drives massive engagement through humor. "How I stopped procrastinating" content has evergreen appeal. Overlaps with the 13.1B #productivity and 40.1B #study ecosystems. However, standalone #procrastination is more of a content hook than a community.

## 29. MEAL PREP

**Hashtag Views:**
- #mealprep: 21B views (995.1K posts, 2M posts on TikTok)
- #mealprepideas: Multi-billion views
- #mealprepsunday: Active
- Related: Overlaps with #whatIeatinaday (2.8B) and food TikTok broadly
- Combined: ~25-30B+ views

# KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

## Biggest Gaps (High Demand, Low App Saturation on TikTok):
1. **Quit Caffeine** - Active community, virtually NO dedicated quit-caffeine app being promoted
2. **NoFap / Quit Porn** - Explosive engagement, very limited app promotion (Fortify is small)
3. **Cold Plunge** - Strong visual content, only Wim Hof app exists (general timer apps)
4. **No Sugar Challenge** - 36.5M posts but no dominant sugar-quit tracking app
5. **Quit Weed** - Small but passionate community, Grounded is nearly alone
6. **Social Media Detox** - Growing anxiety, One Sec/Opal exist but space is young
7. **Screen Time / Phone Addiction** - Cultural moment, limited dedicated tracking apps promoted

## Content Formats That Drive App Virality on TikTok:
1. **"Day X of..." streak/challenge content** - naturally showcases counter/tracker apps
2. **Before/after transformations** - provides visual proof that drives app downloads
3. **App reveal/showcase in routine videos** - "here's the app that changed my life"
4. **Screen recording tutorials** - showing the app in action builds trust
5. **Challenge/community content** - "join me for 30 days of X" creates download urgency

## Platform Trends Favoring App Virality:
- TikTok's 2025 "Great Lock-In" trend = perfect for habit/discipline apps
- Algorithm favors mental health and wellbeing content (Washington Post confirmed)
- "Small wins" and relatable vulnerability content outperforming flex/aspirational content in 2025
- TikTok Shop integration means apps can now be promoted alongside physical products
