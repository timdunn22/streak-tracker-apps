```

### Detailed Description

```
LeadHarvest turns Google Maps into your most powerful lead generation tool. Search for any business category in any location, and LeadHarvest automatically extracts complete contact information — business name, address, phone number, website, email addresses, social media links, and business category — all from a single search.

Stop manually copying business details one by one. LeadHarvest scrapes entire search result pages and organizes everything into a clean, exportable format. Whether you're building a prospecting list, doing local SEO outreach, or researching competitors, LeadHarvest saves you hours of tedious data entry.

- Email finder: Automatically crawls business websites to discover email addresses and contact forms
- Social link extraction: Pulls Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and YouTube profiles from business pages

The email finder goes one step further — it visits each business website in the background and scans for email addresses, contact page links, and mailto: links so you get direct email contacts without leaving Google Maps.

PRIVACY
-------
LeadHarvest does NOT transmit your data to any external server. All scraping happens locally in your browser. Your collected leads are stored in chrome.storage on your device. The email finder only visits publicly accessible business websites that are already listed on Google Maps. No analytics, no tracking, no data collection.

## 2. ProposalPilot — Upwork Proposal Assistant

**Directory:** `proposal-pilot-extension/`

### Name (75 char max)

```
ProposalPilot — Upwork Proposal Assistant & Job Scorer
```

### Short Description (132 char max)

```
Write winning Upwork proposals faster. AI job scoring 1-10, red flag alerts, merge-field templates, and a proposal tracking dashboard.
```

### Detailed Description

```
ProposalPilot is the Upwork proposal writing assistant that helps freelancers win more contracts by writing better proposals in less time. It scores every job posting on a 1-10 scale, flags potential red flags before you waste connects, and lets you insert personalized proposal templates with one click.

If you are spending 20-30 minutes per Upwork proposal and still getting ghosted, ProposalPilot fixes that. The average freelancer sends generic proposals and wonders why their hire rate is under 5%. ProposalPilot helps you focus on the RIGHT jobs and customize your proposals in seconds instead of minutes.

FEATURES
--------
- Job scoring (1-10): Every job posting gets an instant quality score based on budget, client history, hire rate, description length, and payment verification
- Red flag detection: Automatically warns you about unrealistic expectations, vague requirements, unverified payment methods, low budgets relative to scope, and clients with poor hire rates
- Merge field templates: Create reusable proposal templates with dynamic fields like {client_name}, {project_type}, {my_rate}, {timeline}, and {portfolio_link} — fields auto-fill from the job posting
- One-click insertion: Insert your template directly into the Upwork proposal text box with all merge fields populated
- Proposal tracking dashboard: Track every proposal you send — see which ones got views, interviews, and hires
- Template library: Save unlimited templates organized by job category (web dev, design, writing, marketing, VA, etc.)
- Response rate analytics: See your overall response rate, interview rate, and hire rate over time
- Character counter: Upwork proposals have a hidden sweet spot — ProposalPilot shows the optimal length range
- Job bookmarking: Save interesting jobs to apply later without losing them in the feed

WHY CHOOSE PROPOSALPILOT
-------------------------
- More focused than Upwork's built-in tools: Upwork shows you jobs but gives no guidance on which are worth your connects. ProposalPilot scores every job so you stop wasting connects on dead-end postings
- Alternative to Freelancer Map or manual tracking spreadsheets: Everything lives in one sidebar right next to the job posting
- Better than generic AI writers: ChatGPT can write a proposal but it cannot read the job posting context, auto-fill client details, or track your results. ProposalPilot does all three
- Cheaper than Upwork Plus: Get proposal-writing superpowers for $12.99/month instead of paying for Upwork's premium subscription that does not actually help you write better proposals
- Used by Top Rated freelancers who need to maintain high JSS (Job Success Score) by being selective about which jobs they bid on

PERFECT FOR
-----------
- Freelance developers, designers, writers, and marketers on Upwork
- Virtual assistants applying to multiple jobs daily
- Agency owners managing proposals across team members
- New freelancers learning what makes a good job posting vs. a waste of connects
- Anyone spending more than 15 minutes per Upwork proposal

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Browse any job posting on Upwork — ProposalPilot's sidebar appears automatically
2. See the job score (1-10) and any red flags instantly
3. Choose a template from your library or create a new one
4. Merge fields auto-fill with details from the job posting (client name, budget, etc.)
5. Click "Insert" to paste your customized proposal into the Upwork text box
6. Submit your proposal — ProposalPilot logs it to your tracking dashboard automatically

PRIVACY
-------
ProposalPilot does NOT transmit your proposals, templates, or Upwork data to any external server. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your templates and proposal history are stored in chrome.storage on your device. The extension only reads publicly visible job posting information from the Upwork pages you visit.

Permissions explained:
- "activeTab": Read job posting details from the current Upwork page
- "storage": Save your templates, proposal history, and preferences
- "host_permissions (upwork.com)": Access Upwork job pages to extract posting details

## 3. NicheScout — KDP & Print-on-Demand Research

**Directory:** `nichescout-extension/`

### Name (75 char max)

```
NicheScout — KDP & Print-on-Demand Niche Research Tool
```

### Short Description (132 char max)

```
Research profitable niches for Amazon KDP, Merch, and Redbubble. BSR-to-sales estimates, niche scores, and keyword suggestions.
```

### Detailed Description

```
NicheScout is the niche research toolkit built specifically for print-on-demand sellers and KDP publishers. It turns Amazon search results into actionable market data — showing you estimated sales, niche competitiveness scores, and keyword opportunities so you can find profitable niches before your competitors do.

Every successful KDP book or Merch design starts with niche research. NicheScout eliminates the guesswork by converting Amazon's Best Sellers Rank (BSR) into estimated daily and monthly sales figures using category-specific formulas, then scoring each niche on demand, competition, and opportunity.

FEATURES
--------
- BSR-to-sales calculator: Convert any Amazon BSR into estimated daily and monthly sales using category-specific formulas for Books, Clothing, Home & Kitchen, Electronics, and more
- Niche scoring algorithm: Every search gets a 1-100 niche score based on average BSR, sales distribution, competition density, review counts, and pricing
- Keyword research: Generate long-tail keyword suggestions from Amazon's autocomplete API — see what real shoppers are searching for
- Search result overlay: Sales estimates and niche scores appear directly on Amazon search result pages — no need to click into individual listings
- Category-specific formulas: Separate BSR-to-sales conversion curves for Books, Kindle eBooks, Clothing, Home & Kitchen, Electronics, Toys, Sports, and more — because BSR #10,000 means very different things in different categories
- Trend indicators: See whether a niche is trending up, stable, or declining based on BSR movement patterns
- Competitor analysis: View estimated revenue, review velocity, and listing age for top competitors in any niche
- One-click export: Download niche research data as CSV for your spreadsheets and planning tools
- Search history: All your research is saved locally so you can compare niches over time

WHY CHOOSE NICHESCOUT
---------------------
- More affordable than DS Amazon Quick View: Get BSR-to-sales estimates and niche scoring for $12.99/month instead of $20+/month
- Better BSR formulas than free calculators: Most free BSR calculators use a single generic formula. NicheScout uses category-specific curves calibrated for 2025-2026 sales volumes
- Alternative to Publisher Rocket (formerly KDP Rocket): Publisher Rocket is a $97 one-time desktop app. NicheScout lives in your browser, updates automatically, and costs less per year
- More niche-focused than Jungle Scout or Helium 10: Those tools are built for private label FBA sellers. NicheScout is purpose-built for KDP publishers and print-on-demand creators who need BSR data, not supplier databases
- Complements Book Bolt: Use Book Bolt for interior design and NicheScout for niche validation and keyword research
- Faster than manual BSR checking: Stop opening 20 listings individually to check BSR — see all estimates on the search results page at once

PERFECT FOR
-----------
- Amazon KDP publishers researching low-content and medium-content book niches
- Merch by Amazon designers validating t-shirt niche demand
- Redbubble and TeePublic creators looking for trending design topics
- Print-on-demand sellers on Etsy researching what Amazon shoppers want
- Self-published authors choosing profitable book categories
- Side hustlers evaluating KDP niches before investing time in content creation

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Search for any niche on Amazon (e.g., "cat coloring book" or "funny fishing t-shirt")
2. NicheScout overlays estimated sales, revenue, and niche scores directly on the search results
3. Click any result to see detailed BSR history, competitor breakdown, and keyword suggestions
4. Use the keyword tool to discover related long-tail search terms from Amazon autocomplete
5. Export your research to CSV for further analysis

The niche scoring algorithm weighs five factors: average sales volume (high is good), sales distribution (even is better than top-heavy), competition count (fewer is better), average review count (lower means easier entry), and price point (higher means more royalty per sale).

PRIVACY
-------
NicheScout does NOT collect, transmit, or store any of your data on external servers. All calculations and analysis happen locally in your browser. Your research history is stored in chrome.storage on your device. The extension reads publicly visible Amazon search result data and uses Amazon's public autocomplete API for keyword suggestions. No API keys required, no account creation needed.

Permissions explained:
- "activeTab": Read product data from Amazon search result pages
- "storage": Save your research history and preferences
- "host_permissions (amazon.com)": Access Amazon pages to extract BSR, pricing, and review data

## 4. EtsyRank Pro — Etsy SEO Dashboard

**Directory:** `etsyrank-extension/`

### Name (75 char max)

```
EtsyRank Pro — Etsy SEO Audit, Keywords & Listing Optimizer
```

### Short Description (132 char max)

```
8-point SEO audit with A-F grades for every Etsy listing. Keyword research, tag analysis, and competitor insights. Free 10 audits/day.
```

### Detailed Description

```
EtsyRank Pro is the most comprehensive Etsy SEO audit tool available as a Chrome extension. It analyzes every listing across 8 critical SEO factors, assigns a letter grade (A through F) on a 100-point scale, and gives you specific, actionable recommendations to improve your Etsy search ranking.

Etsy search is the #1 traffic source for most shops. If your listings are not optimized, you are invisible to millions of shoppers. EtsyRank Pro shows you exactly what to fix — no guesswork, no generic advice, just data-driven SEO scoring for every listing in your shop.

FEATURES
--------
- 8-point SEO audit: Every listing is scored across eight ranking factors with individual grades and an overall score
  1. Title length: Checks if your title uses the full 140-character limit for maximum keyword coverage
  2. Front-loading: Verifies that your most important keywords appear in the first 40 characters of the title (where Etsy search weighs them heaviest)
  3. Keyword density: Analyzes keyword distribution across title, tags, and description to avoid stuffing while maximizing relevance
  4. Tag count: Confirms you are using all 13 available tags (most sellers leave tags empty)
  5. Long-tail tags: Checks whether your tags are multi-word phrases (which convert better) vs. single generic words
  6. Tag-title overlap: Measures how many of your tags also appear in your title for reinforced relevance signals
  7. Description quality: Evaluates description length, keyword usage, and structure
  8. Photo count: Checks whether you are using all 10 image slots (listings with 10 images rank higher and convert better)
- Letter grading (A-F): Each factor gets a grade, and the listing gets an overall score out of 100
- Keyword research: Discover high-traffic keywords from Etsy's autocomplete — see what real Etsy shoppers type into search
- Competitor analysis: Audit any listing on Etsy, not just your own — see exactly how top sellers optimize their SEO
- Tag suggestions: Get recommended tags based on your title, category, and what top-ranking competitors use
- Bulk audit: Scan your entire shop's listings from the Etsy listing manager and see which ones need SEO attention
- SEO trend tracking: Re-audit listings over time to see if your changes improved your scores

WHY CHOOSE ETSYRANK PRO
------------------------
- More actionable than eRank: eRank shows you data but leaves you guessing about what to fix. EtsyRank Pro gives you specific grades on specific factors with specific recommendations — fix the red items first, then the yellow ones
- Better than Marmalead for quick audits: Marmalead requires a separate dashboard and monthly subscription starting at $19/month. EtsyRank Pro audits listings directly on Etsy for $9.99/month
- Free alternative to Sale Samurai for keyword research: EtsyRank Pro's keyword tool uses Etsy's own autocomplete data, the same data shoppers generate, giving you real demand signals
- Complements EverBee: EverBee focuses on sales estimates and revenue data. EtsyRank Pro focuses on SEO optimization. Use both together for the complete picture
- More Etsy-specific than generic SEO tools: Google-focused SEO tools do not understand Etsy's tag system, 140-character title limit, or 13-tag maximum. EtsyRank Pro is built exclusively for Etsy's search algorithm

PERFECT FOR
-----------
- New Etsy sellers who need to learn SEO fundamentals through letter-grade feedback
- Established shops with 50+ listings that need a quick way to identify underperforming listings
- Print-on-demand sellers optimizing listings across large catalogs
- Vintage and handmade sellers competing in crowded categories
- Etsy SEO consultants auditing client shops
- Anyone whose Etsy traffic has dropped and needs to diagnose why

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Visit any Etsy listing page — yours or a competitor's
2. Click the EtsyRank Pro icon to run an instant SEO audit
3. See your overall grade (A-F) and scores for all 8 SEO factors
4. Read specific recommendations for each factor (e.g., "Add 4 more tags — you are only using 9 of 13")
5. Use the keyword research tab to find high-traffic tags for your niche
6. Implement changes and re-audit to see your score improve

PRIVACY

## 5. ColdFlow — Gmail Cold Email Sequences

**Directory:** `coldflow-extension/`

### Name (75 char max)

```
ColdFlow — Cold Email Sequences & Templates for Gmail
```

### Short Description (132 char max)

```
Send cold email sequences from Gmail. Multi-step follow-ups, CSV import, merge fields, reply tracking, and A/B testing. 100% free tier.
```

### Detailed Description

```
ColdFlow turns your regular Gmail account into a cold email outreach platform. Create multi-step email sequences with automatic follow-ups, import contacts from CSV, personalize every email with merge fields, and track replies — all without leaving Gmail and without paying for expensive outreach software.

Most cold email tools cost $50-200/month, require a separate sending infrastructure, and force you to learn a new platform. ColdFlow works directly inside Gmail, uses your existing email account, and costs a fraction of the price. If you are a freelancer, founder, or salesperson doing outbound outreach, ColdFlow is the simplest way to send personalized cold emails at scale.

FEATURES
--------
- Multi-step sequences: Create sequences with 2, 3, 4, or more follow-up emails that send automatically if the prospect does not reply
- Scheduling via chrome.alarms: Set delays between sequence steps (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, etc.) — follow-ups send automatically when Gmail is open
- 10 built-in templates: Pre-written cold email templates for sales outreach, freelance pitching, partnership requests, link building, job seeking, investor outreach, and more
- CSV contact import: Upload a CSV with name, email, company, and any custom fields — ColdFlow maps columns automatically
- Merge field personalization: Use {first_name}, {company}, {role}, {custom_1}, {custom_2}, and more in your templates — each email is personalized per contact
- Reply tracking: ColdFlow detects when a prospect replies and automatically pauses their sequence — no awkward double follow-ups
- A/B testing: Create two versions of any email in a sequence and ColdFlow randomly assigns contacts to version A or B, then shows you which performs better
- Contact management: Tag contacts, add notes, filter by sequence status (pending, active, replied, bounced)
- Send rate limiting: Configurable delays between emails to protect your Gmail sending reputation (recommended: 30-60 seconds between sends)
- Sequence analytics: Open rate proxy (via tracking pixel optional), reply rate, bounce rate, and sequence completion rate
- Template library: Save and organize unlimited email templates by category

WHY CHOOSE COLDFLOW
--------------------
- 10x cheaper than Mailshake: Mailshake starts at $59/month for basic outreach. ColdFlow Premium is $14.99/month with the same core features
- Simpler than Lemlist or Woodpecker: No separate platform to learn, no SMTP configuration, no DNS records to set up. ColdFlow works inside Gmail — if you can send an email, you can use ColdFlow
- More powerful than GMass for sequences: GMass is great for mail merge but its sequence builder is limited. ColdFlow's multi-step sequences with conditional follow-ups and A/B testing go beyond basic mail merge
- Alternative to Instantly.ai or Smartlead for solopreneurs: Those tools are built for agencies sending 10,000+ emails/day from multiple inboxes. ColdFlow is built for freelancers and small teams sending 50-200 personalized emails per day from their own Gmail
- No external server required: Your emails are sent directly from Gmail, through Google's servers, with your normal sending reputation — no third-party relay that could land you in spam
- Works with Google Workspace and free Gmail accounts

PERFECT FOR
-----------
- Freelancers doing outbound client acquisition
- Startup founders doing cold outreach to investors, partners, or early customers
- Sales reps who prefer Gmail over enterprise CRM email tools
- Recruiters reaching out to candidates
- Link builders and digital PR professionals
- Real estate agents following up with leads
- Anyone who sends repetitive personalized emails and wants to automate follow-ups

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Import contacts from CSV or add them manually in the ColdFlow sidebar
2. Create a sequence: write your first email and add follow-up steps with delays
3. Personalize with merge fields — {first_name}, {company}, etc. auto-fill per contact
4. Start the sequence — ColdFlow composes and sends emails through Gmail's native compose window
5. Follow-ups send automatically on schedule when Gmail is open
6. When a prospect replies, their sequence pauses automatically
7. Track results in the ColdFlow dashboard: reply rates, A/B test winners, and sequence progress

PRIVACY
-------
ColdFlow does NOT route your emails through any external server. Every email is sent directly from your Gmail account through Google's servers. Your contacts, templates, and sequence data are stored locally in chrome.storage on your device. ColdFlow does not read emails you receive — it only detects replies to sequence emails by checking subject lines for thread matching. No analytics, no data collection, no third-party access to your Gmail.

Permissions explained:
- "activeTab": Interact with the Gmail compose window to send emails
- "storage": Save your contacts, templates, sequences, and analytics
- "alarms": Schedule follow-up emails at the correct intervals
- "host_permissions (mail.google.com)": Access Gmail to compose and send emails

## 6. LinkedBoost — LinkedIn Content Toolkit

**Directory:** `linkedboost-extension/`

### Name (75 char max)

```
LinkedBoost — LinkedIn Text Formatter, CRM & Content Toolkit
```

### Short Description (132 char max)

```
Bold & italic text on LinkedIn, DM templates, connection CRM, post scheduling, emoji picker, and analytics. Grow your LinkedIn faster.
```

### Detailed Description

```
LinkedBoost is the all-in-one LinkedIn growth toolkit for creators, salespeople, and professionals who want to stand out in the feed. Format your posts with bold and italic text (which LinkedIn does not natively support), manage your connections in a built-in CRM, send personalized DMs with templates, and track your post performance — all from a sidebar that lives right on LinkedIn.

LinkedIn's algorithm rewards engagement, and engagement starts with posts that are visually distinct. Bold and italic text formatting makes your posts pop in a sea of plain text. LinkedBoost uses Unicode character mapping to create formatted text that works natively on LinkedIn — no special apps, no copy-pasting from external tools.

FEATURES
--------
- Unicode bold & italic formatting: Convert any text to bold, italic, bold italic, or special Unicode styles that render on LinkedIn (no markdown, no tricks — it just works)
- DM templates: Save reusable direct message templates for connection requests, follow-ups, sales outreach, and networking
- Connection CRM: Tag connections, add notes, set follow-up reminders, and track your outreach pipeline in a lightweight CRM sidebar
- Post templates: Save high-performing post formats (hooks, carousels, story frameworks) and insert them with one click
- Emoji picker: Quick-access emoji picker organized by category with a search function — find the right emoji without scrolling through LinkedIn's limited picker
- Character counter: See your post length in real time with visual indicators for the optimal range (1,200-1,500 characters for maximum reach)
- Content scheduling: Draft posts and schedule them for specific days and times — ColdFlow opens LinkedIn and posts at the scheduled time when your browser is open
- Post analytics: Track impressions, likes, comments, and shares for your recent posts in one dashboard
- Hashtag suggestions: Get recommended hashtags based on your post content and trending topics

WHY CHOOSE LINKEDBOOST
-----------------------
- The only extension with real Unicode formatting: Other "LinkedIn formatters" are web apps that require copy-pasting. LinkedBoost formats text directly in LinkedIn's post composer — highlight text, click bold, done
- More affordable than Shield Analytics: Shield charges $8/month just for analytics. LinkedBoost includes analytics plus formatting, CRM, templates, and scheduling for $14.99/month
- Better than AuthoredUp for daily use: AuthoredUp is a great drafting tool but it opens in a separate window. LinkedBoost lives on LinkedIn in a sidebar — no context switching
- Alternative to Dux-Soup for connection management: Dux-Soup focuses on automation (which can get your account restricted). LinkedBoost focuses on organization — tag, note, and track your connections without risky automation
- Replaces 4-5 separate tools: Text formatter + CRM + DM templates + analytics + scheduler — all in one extension instead of juggling Taplio, Shield, AuthoredUp, and a spreadsheet
- Works with LinkedIn free, Premium, Sales Navigator, and Recruiter accounts

PERFECT FOR
-----------
- LinkedIn content creators building a personal brand
- B2B salespeople managing outbound LinkedIn outreach
- Founders and CEOs who post regularly to build thought leadership
- Recruiters sending personalized connection requests and InMails
- Coaches and consultants using LinkedIn as their primary lead generation channel
- Marketing professionals managing company LinkedIn pages
- Anyone who wants their LinkedIn posts to look more professional and get more engagement

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Navigate to LinkedIn — the LinkedBoost sidebar appears automatically
2. To format text: Type in LinkedIn's post composer, highlight text, and click Bold, Italic, or any style from the LinkedBoost toolbar
3. To use DM templates: Open a LinkedIn message thread, choose a template, and insert it with merge fields like {first_name} auto-filled
4. To track connections: Click any profile to add tags, notes, and follow-up dates in the CRM sidebar
5. To schedule posts: Draft your post, choose a date and time, and LinkedBoost will post it when your browser is open
6. To view analytics: Open the LinkedBoost dashboard to see impressions, engagement, and growth metrics

The character counter shows green (optimal range), yellow (too short), or red (too long) so you can hit the sweet spot for LinkedIn's algorithm every time.

PRIVACY
-------
LinkedBoost does NOT access your LinkedIn credentials, password, or authentication tokens. It does not send automated messages or perform automated actions — every message and post requires your confirmation. Your CRM data, templates, and analytics are stored locally in chrome.storage on your device. No external servers, no data collection, no third-party access.

Permissions explained:
- "activeTab": Interact with LinkedIn pages to insert formatted text and read post metrics
- "storage": Save your CRM data, templates, analytics, and preferences
- "alarms": Schedule post reminders at specific times
- "host_permissions (linkedin.com)": Access LinkedIn pages to provide formatting, CRM, and analytics features

## 7. FlipFlow — Reseller Cross-Platform Listing Manager

**Directory:** `flipflow-extension/`

### Name (75 char max)

```
FlipFlow — Poshmark Sharer & Cross-Platform Listing Manager
```

### Short Description (132 char max)

```
Auto-share Poshmark closet, cross-list to eBay & Mercari, profit calculator with fee breakdowns. Reseller toolkit. Free 10 shares/day.
```

### Detailed Description

```
FlipFlow is the reseller's best friend — a cross-platform listing tool that lets you copy listings between Poshmark, eBay, and Mercari with one click, auto-share your Poshmark closet with human-like timing, and calculate your true profit after every marketplace's fees. If you are selling on multiple platforms, FlipFlow eliminates the most tedious parts of reselling: manual cross-listing, repetitive sharing, and mental math on fees.

Cross-listing is the single biggest growth lever for resellers. Listings on one platform get seen by that platform's audience. Listings on three platforms get seen by three audiences. But manually recreating the same listing on Poshmark, eBay, and Mercari takes 10-15 minutes per item. FlipFlow copies all listing details (title, description, photos, price, size, category) in one click and auto-fills the listing form on the destination marketplace.

FEATURES
--------
- Cross-platform listing copy: Copy a listing from Poshmark, eBay, or Mercari and paste it to any other marketplace. Title, description, item specifics, price, and photos are transferred automatically
- Auto-fill listing forms: When pasting to a new marketplace, FlipFlow fills in as many fields as possible — title, description, price, category, size, color, and condition
- Poshmark auto-sharer: Automatically share your entire Poshmark closet or selected items with human-like 2-5 second random delays between shares to avoid detection
- Smart share scheduling: Set share times throughout the day — FlipFlow shares during peak Poshmark traffic hours (7-9 AM, 12-2 PM, 7-10 PM)
- Profit calculator: Enter your purchase price and see your net profit after fees on every marketplace — Poshmark's 20% commission, eBay's 13.25% + $0.30, Mercari's 10%, and shipping costs
- Fee comparison: See side-by-side fee breakdowns across all three marketplaces to decide where to list each item for maximum profit
- Inventory tracker: Mark items as listed, sold, or unlisted across platforms from one dashboard
- Bulk operations: Share multiple items, copy multiple listings, or update prices across platforms in batches
- Share counter: Track daily shares with pause and resume controls
- Activity log: See a complete history of shares, copies, and cross-listings

WHY CHOOSE FLIPFLOW
--------------------
- More affordable than Vendoo: Vendoo charges $12-30/month for cross-listing. FlipFlow Premium is $19.99/month and includes cross-listing PLUS Poshmark sharing PLUS profit calculators — tools that Vendoo charges extra for or does not offer
- Better Poshmark sharing than Closet Tools or PosherVA: FlipFlow uses human-like random delays (2-5 seconds, not a fixed interval) and mimics natural scrolling behavior to minimize detection risk. No CAPTCHA triggers, no account warnings
- Alternative to List Perfectly for casual resellers: List Perfectly starts at $29/month and is built for power sellers with 500+ listings. FlipFlow is built for resellers with 10-200 active listings who want a simple, affordable tool
- More integrated than separate sharer + crosslister: Instead of paying for one Poshmark sharing bot AND one cross-listing tool, FlipFlow combines both into a single extension
- Replaces your profit calculator spreadsheet: Stop switching to Google Sheets to calculate fees. FlipFlow shows your net profit on every listing page with accurate, up-to-date fee structures for Poshmark, eBay, and Mercari
- No external account or API keys required: Everything runs in your browser. No connecting marketplace accounts to a third-party server, no OAuth permissions, no risk of account linking

PERFECT FOR
-----------
- Poshmark resellers who need to share their closet daily to stay visible in search
- eBay sellers expanding to Poshmark or Mercari without manually recreating listings
- Mercari sellers who want to cross-list to eBay and Poshmark for more exposure
- Thrift resellers and vintage sellers managing inventory across multiple platforms
- Side hustlers flipping items from thrift stores, garage sales, or retail arbitrage
- Full-time resellers who spend hours per day on manual sharing and cross-listing
- Anyone who has typed the same listing description into three different marketplace forms

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Navigate to any listing on Poshmark, eBay, or Mercari
2. Click the FlipFlow icon to see the listing sidebar with copy, share, and profit calculator options
3. To cross-list: Click "Copy Listing" — FlipFlow saves the title, description, photos, and item details. Navigate to the destination marketplace and click "Paste Listing" — FlipFlow auto-fills the listing form
4. To auto-share on Poshmark: Go to your Poshmark closet, click "Share All" or select specific items, and FlipFlow shares each item with randomized 2-5 second delays
5. To calculate profit: Enter your cost and FlipFlow shows net profit after fees for Poshmark (20%), eBay (13.25%), and Mercari (10%) side by side

The cross-listing flow preserves all item details including title, description, price, size, color, condition, and photos. Photos are saved locally so you can paste them into the destination marketplace's upload form.

PRIVACY
-------
FlipFlow does NOT access your marketplace account credentials, passwords, or API tokens. It does not log into your accounts or perform actions without your initiation. Your listing data, inventory, and share history are stored locally in chrome.storage on your device. No external servers, no data collection, no third-party access to your marketplace accounts. The auto-sharer clicks buttons on the page exactly as you would — it does not use private APIs or hidden endpoints.

Permissions explained:
- "activeTab": Read listing data from the current marketplace page
- "storage": Save your copied listings, inventory, share history, and preferences
- "alarms": Schedule auto-shares at configured intervals
- "host_permissions (poshmark.com, ebay.com, mercari.com)": Access marketplace pages to read listings, fill forms, and share items
