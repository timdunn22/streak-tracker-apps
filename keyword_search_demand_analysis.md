## TIER 4: MEDIUM-LOW DEMAND

---

---

### #16. "Testosterone Tracker App" / "Testosterone Optimization App"

---

## TIER 5: LOW DEMAND (But Potentially Emerging)

---

### #10. "Quit Caffeine App"

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Google Trends Direction** | MINIMAL — Very niche concept, not yet mainstream |
| **Est. Monthly Search Volume** | 500-2,000 (combined) |
| **Seasonality** | No clear seasonal pattern |
| **Rising Queries** | "daily rating app," "life dashboard app," "wellness score app" |
| **Search Demand Rating** | **LOW** |
| **Notes** | Rate My Day and LifeScore exist as apps but have minimal visibility. Daylio (mood tracker) captures some of this intent. The concept is novel but lacks established search demand. Users don't know to search for this — it's a product-led discovery category. Would require heavy marketing/content creation to build demand. |

- **Pregnancy tracker app** — Captive audience for 9+ months, high LTV

### 2. Best "Blue Ocean" Opportunities (Rising Demand + Low Competition):
- **Quit porn / NoFap app** — QUITTR proving $250K MRR is achievable. 25% CVR. Multiple apps but market still early
- **Quit vaping app** — Only 3% of vaping apps are quit-focused. HUGE supply gap
- **Cold plunge tracker** — 70% YoY search growth but very few dedicated apps
- **Testosterone tracker app** — Emerging niche with highly monetizable male demographic
- **Quit sugar app** — Viral #NoSugarChallenge creates demand waves

### 3. Most Dangerous Categories (High Competition, Established Incumbents):
- **Calorie counter app** — MyFitnessPal (200M users), Lose It!, Cronometer dominate
- **Pregnancy tracker app** — Flo Health, What to Expect, BabyCenter are entrenched
- **Workout tracker app** — Strong, Hevy, JEFIT, Nike Training Club, etc.
- **Budget tracker app** — YNAB, Mint (now Credit Karma), PocketGuard
- **Habit tracker app** — Streaks, Habitica, Habitify, Fabulous

### 4. Best Risk-Adjusted Opportunities (Meaningful Demand + Manageable Competition):
1. **Quit vaping app** (supply gap is enormous)
2. **Quit porn / NoFap app** (proven revenue, growing fast)
3. **Cold plunge tracker** (rising trend, few apps)
4. **Quit sugar app** (viral potential, few dedicated apps)
5. **Reading tracker / Book tracker app** (Goodreads dissatisfaction creates opening)
6. **Testosterone tracker app** (emerging niche, monetizable demographic)
