# Reddit Demand Research: 30 App Idea Niches
## Comprehensive Analysis of Community Size, Activity, and Demand Signals

---

## 1. QUIT SMOKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/stopsmoking (~187K members)
**Related:** r/NicotineAnonymous (small)

**Activity Level:** Moderate-high. Consistent daily posts from people on Day 1, sharing milestones, and asking for help with cravings. Community acts as an accountability group.

**App Demand Signals:** People frequently ask "what app helped you quit?" and the Smoke Free app dominates recommendations. QuitSure and Smokefree (gov) also mentioned. There IS active demand, but a dominant app (Smoke Free) already exists and is well-loved.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** Smoke Free's premium paywall ($4.99) is sometimes complained about. Users want free options with good tracking.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Established niche with a clear market leader. Room for differentiation but not an unserved gap.

---

## 2. QUIT DRINKING / SOBRIETY

**Primary Subreddit:** r/stopdrinking (~600K+ members)
**Related:** r/alcoholism (~100K), r/dryalcoholics (~80K), r/Sober

**Activity Level:** Extremely high. One of Reddit's most active support communities. New posts every few minutes. Strong "I will not drink with you today" (IWNDWYT) culture. Very high engagement per post.

**App Demand Signals:** Frequent recommendations for Sober Time, Nomo, EasyQuit Drinking, and I Am Sober. Users actively seek apps for streak counting, motivation, and community. People regularly ask "what app are you using?"

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** I Am Sober's subscription model gets pushback. Users want something free, simple, and private. Complaints about bloated features when people just want a clean day counter.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Massive, emotionally invested community. High willingness to try new apps. Existing apps have clear gaps (subscription fatigue, over-complexity).

---

## 3. NOFAP / QUIT PORN

**Primary Subreddit:** r/NoFap (~1.2M members)
**Related:** r/pornfree (~250K), r/PornAddiction

**Activity Level:** Extremely high. One of the most passionate/evangelical communities on Reddit. Multiple posts per hour. High engagement, emotional vulnerability, progress reports.

**App Demand Signals:** Very strong. People constantly ask for app recommendations. Apps like QUITTR, Fortify, Brainbuddy, BeatIt, and BlockerX are regularly discussed. The NoFap website even has its own official tracker. Users want streak counters, accountability tools, and porn blockers.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** Many apps feel "preachy" or overly religious (Fortify). Subscription costs are a barrier. Some apps are buggy. Users want something clean, private, and non-judgmental.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Enormous community with intense demand. Multiple apps competing but none has achieved dominance. High emotional stakes = high retention potential.

---

## 4. DAILY DISCIPLINE / HABIT STREAKS

**Primary Subreddit:** r/getdisciplined (~2.1M members)
**Related:** r/theXeffect (~44K), r/habits, r/Atomic_Habits

**Activity Level:** Very high. r/getdisciplined is one of the largest self-improvement subs on Reddit. Constant posts about building routines, accountability, and systems. r/theXeffect is smaller but deeply focused on streak-based tracking.

**App Demand Signals:** Extremely competitive space. Discussions about Streaks, Habitica, Habitify, Loop, Atoms (from Atomic Habits author), and dozens more. Users frequently ask "what's the best habit tracker?" This is arguably the MOST asked app question on Reddit self-improvement subs.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** Too many features (bloated), subscription pricing, bad UI, not enough flexibility, or too rigid. Users want something minimal but effective.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Massive demand but EXTREMELY crowded market. Very hard to differentiate. The "best habit tracker" question has been asked 10,000 times.

---

## 5. OVERSPENDING / SPENDING TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/personalfinance (~18M members), r/ynab (~200K+)
**Related:** r/Frugal (~2.5M), r/budgetfood, r/povertyfinance (~1.5M)

**Activity Level:** r/personalfinance is one of the largest subs on all of Reddit. r/ynab is extremely active with passionate users. Budget discussions happen hourly.

**App Demand Signals:** YNAB dominates all discussions but its $14.99/month price creates constant demand for alternatives. Monarch Money, Copilot, Actual Budget, and spreadsheets are discussed. People ALWAYS asking "what's a good alternative to YNAB?"

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** YNAB is too expensive and has a steep learning curve. Mint is dead. Most free apps feel half-baked. Users want simple spending tracking without needing a finance degree.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- YNAB's pricing creates a massive gap for simpler, cheaper alternatives. The demand is constant and vocal. However, building a finance app is complex (bank integrations, security).

---

## 6. INTERMITTENT FASTING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/intermittentfasting (~910K members)
**Related:** r/fasting (~350K), r/OmadDiet

**Activity Level:** Very high. Daily transformation photos, questions about fasting windows, and app discussions. One of the most active health/wellness subs.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong. Zero (by Kevin Rose) and Simple are the most recommended apps. Fastic, Life Fasting Tracker, and YAZIO also discussed. Users want a good free timer without aggressive upsells.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** Simple app is widely reported as a SCAM -- unauthorized charges, impossible cancellations, and $80/quarter pricing. DoFasting has similar billing complaints. Zero is well-liked but limited free features. Users are DESPERATE for a good free/cheap fasting timer.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Huge community, massive app demand, and existing top apps have earned terrible reputations for predatory subscription practices. Clear opportunity for a trustworthy, fairly priced alternative.

---

## 7. MORNING ROUTINES

**Primary Subreddit:** r/getdisciplined (~2.1M, overlaps heavily), r/morningroutines (small)
**Related:** r/productivity (~400K+), r/selfimprovement (~2.5M)

**Activity Level:** Morning routine discussions happen frequently across multiple subs, but there is no single large dedicated subreddit. Activity is spread across r/getdisciplined, r/productivity, and r/selfimprovement.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate. People discuss Routinery, Fabulous, and general habit trackers. But most users just build morning routines inside their existing habit tracker or alarm app. There's no strong "I need a morning routine app" demand signal.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** Fabulous is too gamified/condescending for some. Routinery is niche. Most people use general habit apps instead.

**DEMAND RATING: COLD** -- No large dedicated community. Demand is diluted across general productivity/habit communities. Hard to justify a standalone app when habit trackers cover this.

---

## 8. NIGHT / EVENING ROUTINES

**Primary Subreddit:** No dedicated subreddit exists.
**Related:** r/sleep (~250K), r/getdisciplined, r/selfimprovement

**Activity Level:** Very low as a standalone topic. Evening routines come up occasionally in broader self-improvement discussions but lack their own community identity.

**App Demand Signals:** Minimal. People discuss sleep hygiene apps (f.lux, etc.) and general habit trackers, but nobody is searching for "evening routine app" specifically.

**Complaints:** N/A -- not enough app demand to generate complaints.

**DEMAND RATING: COLD** -- No community, no dedicated demand. This would be a feature inside another app, not a standalone product.

---

## 9. SCREEN TIME / PHONE ADDICTION

**Primary Subreddit:** r/nosurf (~280K members)
**Related:** r/digitalminimalism (~199K), r/phonesarebad

**Activity Level:** High. Both communities are very active with daily posts about struggles with phone addiction, strategies, and app recommendations. Strong emotional engagement.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong. Discussions about Forest, Freedom, Cold Turkey, One Sec, Opal, ScreenZen, and built-in Screen Time (iOS). People actively search for effective blockers.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** iOS Screen Time is too easy to bypass (just tap "ignore"). Most blocker apps can be uninstalled during a weak moment. Users want something that actually LOCKS them out. Subscription pricing for what feels like a simple feature.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Combined ~480K members across two active communities. Strong demand, real pain points with existing solutions (too easy to bypass). The "make it actually impossible to cheat" angle is underserved.

---

## 10. QUIT CAFFEINE

**Primary Subreddit:** r/decaf (~53K members)
**Related:** r/CaffeineFreeLife (tiny)

**Activity Level:** Moderate. Daily posts about withdrawal symptoms, timelines, and motivation. Surprisingly passionate community given its size -- members treat caffeine like a serious addiction.

**App Demand Signals:** Low-to-moderate. There is no dominant "quit caffeine" app. People use general streak counters (I Am Sober, etc.) or just count days manually. Occasional posts asking "is there an app for tracking caffeine withdrawal?"

**Complaints:** No dominant app to complain about. The gap IS the complaint -- there's nothing purpose-built.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Small but passionate community with no dedicated app. Could be an easy win as a niche product, but the addressable market is small.

---

## 11. QUIT WEED / CANNABIS

**Primary Subreddit:** r/leaves (~300K+ members)
**Related:** r/Petioles (~80K, for moderation rather than quitting)

**Activity Level:** High. Daily posts with emotional stories, withdrawal timelines, and support. Very active and supportive community. Media coverage from SF Gate, Leafly, and academic journals.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate. People use Grounded (a quit weed app), I Am Sober, and Sober Time. But there's no dominant, well-known quit-weed-specific app. Users sometimes ask for recommendations.

**Complaints:** Grounded is liked but basic. General sobriety apps don't address cannabis-specific withdrawal symptoms (vivid dreams, appetite changes, insomnia). Users want something that understands the weed-specific journey.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Large, active community with no dominant app. Cannabis-specific withdrawal tracking is an underserved niche. Growing cultural relevance as legal weed leads to more dependency issues.

---

## 12. QUIT VAPING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/QuitVaping (~62K members)
**Related:** r/electronic_cigarette (for vaping, not quitting)

**Activity Level:** Moderate. Growing community. Post volume spiked during the 2019 vaping lung injury crisis and has maintained steady growth since. Daily posts.

**App Demand Signals:** Low-to-moderate. People typically use general quit-smoking apps (Smoke Free, QuitNow) since there's no vaping-specific dominant app. Some posts asking "is there an app specifically for quitting vaping?"

**Complaints:** Quit smoking apps don't quite fit -- they track "cigarettes not smoked" which doesn't map to vaping (pods, puffs). Users want something designed for vaping-specific metrics.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Growing niche (Gen Z is the core demographic). No vaping-specific quitting app has broken out. Generational relevance is high -- this could grow fast as vaping addiction becomes a bigger cultural conversation.

---

## 13. PREGNANCY TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/BabyBumps (~281K members)
**Related:** r/pregnant (~350K+), r/beyondthebump, r/TryingForABaby

**Activity Level:** Very high. These are extremely active communities with constant posts about symptoms, milestones, anxiety, and product/app recommendations.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong but HEAVILY saturated. The Bump, BabyCenter, Ovia, Pregnancy+, Flo, and What To Expect all dominate. Users frequently ask for comparisons between existing apps.

**Complaints:** Apps are bloated with ads and upsells. Privacy concerns (Flo was caught sharing data with Facebook). Some apps feel condescending. Too many notifications.

**DEMAND RATING: COLD** -- Massive communities but an EXTREMELY saturated app market with well-funded incumbents (Flo has $200M+ in funding). Privacy-focused disruption is possible but requires significant resources.

---

## 14. AFFIRMATIONS / GRATITUDE JOURNALING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/Journaling (~162K members)
**Related:** r/Affirmations (~50K est.), r/gratitude (small), r/selfimprovement

**Activity Level:** Moderate for r/Journaling. r/Affirmations is smaller but consistent. Most gratitude/affirmation discussion happens in broader wellness subs.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate. Gratitude (app), Presently, ThinkUp, Happyfeed, and Day One are discussed. People ask about gratitude apps occasionally but it's not a burning need.

**Complaints:** Most gratitude apps are too simple (just a text box). Some are too pushy with premium features. The space feels "nice to have" rather than essential.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Decent community interest but low urgency. People can journal on paper or in Notes. The challenge is retention -- gratitude journaling has notoriously high drop-off rates.

---

## 15. CALORIE & PROTEIN TRACKING (SIMPLE)

**Primary Subreddit:** r/loseit (~4.1M members), r/CICO (~400K+ est.)
**Related:** r/1200isplenty, r/1500isplenty, r/gainit, r/Fitness (~11M)

**Activity Level:** Extremely high. r/loseit is one of Reddit's largest health communities. Calorie tracking is discussed daily across multiple mega-subs.

**App Demand Signals:** Extremely strong. MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, Cronometer, MacroFactor, and YAZIO dominate discussions. People are CONSTANTLY asking for recommendations and comparing apps.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** MyFitnessPal's recent updates are universally hated on Reddit (1.5-star rating on BBB, broken features, slow performance, paywall for basic features). Lose It! is liked but limited. Cronometer is accurate but has a learning curve. People want something SIMPLE -- just scan, log, done.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- MyFitnessPal's fall from grace has created a massive opening. The "simple calorie tracker" angle is exactly what Reddit users are begging for. Enormous addressable market.

---

## 16. TESTOSTERONE OPTIMIZATION

**Primary Subreddit:** r/Testosterone (~208K members)
**Related:** r/TRT, r/moreplatesmoredates, r/Biohackers

**Activity Level:** High. Very active community discussing TRT protocols, bloodwork, symptoms, and optimization. Heavily male, health-focused audience.

**App Demand Signals:** Growing. TRT Tracker, TRT Plus, Mojo (Testosterone Tracker), and OptiPin are all new/recent apps. People discuss tracking injections, bloodwork results, and symptoms. The niche is early but demand is clearly emerging.

**Complaints:** Most TRT apps are very new and basic. Users want better bloodwork trend visualization and protocol optimization. The mainstream apps don't exist yet -- it's mostly indie apps.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Growing niche with increasing cultural relevance (Andrew Huberman, etc.). No dominant app yet. However, the audience is relatively niche and the topic requires medical accuracy.

---

## 17. DEEP WORK / FOCUS TIMER

**Primary Subreddit:** r/productivity (~400K+)
**Related:** r/Pomodoro (small), r/ADHD (~2M+), r/deepwork (small)

**Activity Level:** Focus timer discussions are very active across productivity and ADHD subs. No single dominant dedicated sub, but the topic comes up constantly.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong but saturated. Forest, Focus Keeper, Session, Be Focused, Flow, Toggl Track, and dozens more are discussed. "Best pomodoro app" is one of the most common productivity questions.

**Complaints:** Forest feels gimmicky after a while. Many timer apps are too simple (you can use your phone's built-in timer). Others are too complex. Focus timers need to actually BLOCK distractions, not just run a countdown.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Strong demand but extremely crowded market. Hard to differentiate. The "timer + blocker" combo approach (like Opal or Session) is the most promising angle.

---

## 18. STUDY SESSION TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/GetStudying (~1.5M members)
**Related:** r/studytips, r/college, r/ADHD

**Activity Level:** Very high. Massive student audience constantly discussing study methods, tools, and apps. Particularly active during exam seasons.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong. Forest, Yeolpumta (YPT), Study Bunny, Athenify, and Toggl are discussed. Study timer apps with social/competitive elements are popular (YPT is huge in Korea). Students want to track total study hours and see progress.

**Complaints:** Most study apps are either too simple (just a timer) or too complex (project management tools). Students want something that tracks hours, shows trends, and maybe has a social/competitive element.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Large audience but seasonal demand (peaks during exams). The market is served but not dominated. Korean-style study timer apps (YPT) show there's appetite for social study tracking.

---

## 19. DAILY WEIGHT TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/loseit (~4.1M), r/Fitness (~11M)
**Related:** r/progresspics, r/1200isplenty

**Activity Level:** Very high. Daily weigh-ins are a hot topic. People debate daily vs. weekly weighing constantly.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate-to-strong. Happy Scale (iOS) and Libra (Android) are the clear favorites and frequently recommended. People who don't know about them ask "best app for tracking weight trends."

**Complaints:** Happy Scale locked HealthKit integration behind a paywall. Libra's reminder notifications are unreliable. Neither app is cross-platform. Some users want weight tracking integrated with calorie tracking rather than needing separate apps.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Happy Scale and Libra have loyal followings. Hard to displace them for standalone weight tracking. Better opportunity: build weight tracking INTO a calorie/macro tracker.

---

## 20. SOCIAL MEDIA DETOX

**Primary Subreddit:** r/nosurf (~280K), r/digitalminimalism (~199K)
**Related:** r/socialmedia, r/dumbphones

**Activity Level:** High. (Same communities as #9 - Screen Time / Phone Addiction). Active daily discussions about reducing social media specifically.

**App Demand Signals:** Overlaps heavily with screen time/phone addiction (#9). AppDetox, Digital Detox, Forest, Freedom, and One Sec are discussed. 47% of Americans admit phone addiction per 2024 data.

**Complaints:** Same as #9 -- apps are too easy to bypass, subscriptions for basic blocking, and built-in screen time tools are insufficient.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Largely overlaps with screen time (#9). As a standalone "social media detox" niche, it's narrower. Better as a feature within a broader digital wellness app.

---

## 21. WORKOUT SET LOGGING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/Fitness (~11M members), r/weightroom (~400K+)
**Related:** r/bodybuilding (~2M+), r/powerlifting, r/GYM (~2M+)

**Activity Level:** Extremely high. Some of the most active communities on all of Reddit. Workout logging is discussed constantly.

**App Demand Signals:** Extremely strong. Strong (app), FitNotes, Setgraph, Hevy, Jefit, Fitbod, and Boostcamp are endlessly debated. "Best workout tracker" threads appear weekly. Users are highly opinionated.

**Complaints:** Strong has a workout limit in free tier. FitNotes hasn't been updated in years. Fitbod's algorithm is hit-or-miss. Hevy is gaining ground but has UI complaints. People want speed (fast logging between sets), progressive overload tracking, and minimal friction.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Massive market with intense demand. Despite many options, NO app has achieved clear dominance. Users frequently switch between apps. The "fast, simple set logger" angle continues to be underserved.

---

## 22. DAILY MOOD TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/mentalhealth (~800K+)
**Related:** r/depression (~1M+), r/Anxiety (~700K+), r/bipolar, r/BPD

**Activity Level:** Very high across mental health subs. Mood tracking is frequently discussed as a therapeutic tool, often recommended by therapists.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong. Daylio dominates mood tracking discussions and is frequently the #1 recommendation. Bearable, Reflectly, Moodpath/MindDoc, and Pixels are also mentioned. People regularly ask "what's the best mood tracker?"

**Complaints:** Daylio's free tier is limited. Some apps are too simple (just pick an emoji). Others are too complex (Bearable tracks everything but is overwhelming). Users want the sweet spot: quick daily check-in with useful insights over time.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Daylio is a strong incumbent. The market is served but not perfectly. Best opportunity is in combining mood tracking with other features (journaling, habit correlation).

---

## 23. ANTI-PROCRASTINATION

**Primary Subreddit:** r/getdisciplined (~2.1M), r/procrastination (~150K est.)
**Related:** r/ADHD (~2M+), r/productivity (~400K+)

**Activity Level:** Very high. Procrastination is one of the most discussed topics on Reddit's self-improvement subs. r/ADHD overlaps heavily as executive dysfunction is a core symptom.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate. People discuss website blockers (Freedom, Cold Turkey), accountability tools (Focusmate), task managers (Todoist), and timer apps. But there's no single "anti-procrastination app" that people seek out. The solutions are fragmented.

**Complaints:** Nothing works for long. Users try app after app but the problem is psychological, not technological. Blocking apps get uninstalled. Task managers get ignored. There's a fatigue/skepticism about whether any app can actually solve procrastination.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Massive audience but deep skepticism about tech solutions. The most interesting angle is accountability/social pressure (Focusmate's model). Pure "anti-procrastination" apps haven't cracked the code.

---

## 24. DAILY MOTIVATION

**Primary Subreddit:** r/GetMotivated (~14M+ members)
**Related:** r/selfimprovement (~2.5M), r/decidingtobebetter

**Activity Level:** r/GetMotivated is one of the largest subs on Reddit. Very high post volume, though engagement per post varies. Known for quote images and motivational videos.

**App Demand Signals:** Low-to-moderate. People consume motivation through Reddit, YouTube, podcasts, and Instagram -- not dedicated apps. ThinkUp, Motivation (app), and Fabulous are mentioned occasionally. Most users don't search for "motivation apps."

**Complaints:** Motivation apps feel redundant when you can just scroll r/GetMotivated or YouTube. Push notification quotes get annoying after a week. The problem with motivation apps is that they stop working once the novelty wears off.

**DEMAND RATING: COLD** -- Despite an enormous subreddit, there's no strong demand for a motivation-specific app. Motivation is consumed as content (social media, YouTube) not as a tool. Retention would be extremely poor.

---

## 25. WATER INTAKE TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/HydroHomies (~1.3M members)
**Related:** r/water

**Activity Level:** High, but mostly meme-driven. r/HydroHomies is a meme/lifestyle community about drinking water. It's more cultural than practical. Actual water tracking discussions are sparse.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate. WaterMinder, Plant Nanny, Hydro Coach, and built-in health app features are discussed. People ask about water tracking apps occasionally. But many find that reminders get annoying and tracking water feels like overkill.

**Complaints:** Water tracking apps are annoying (too many reminders). The novelty wears off fast. Most people don't need an app to remember to drink water -- they just need a water bottle on their desk.

**DEMAND RATING: COLD** -- Large community but mostly ironic/meme engagement. Actual demand for water tracking apps is low and retention is poor. This is a "download, use for 3 days, delete" category.

---

## 26. QUIT SUGAR

**Primary Subreddit:** r/sugarfree (~200K est.)
**Related:** r/keto (~3.5M), r/whole30

**Activity Level:** Moderate. r/sugarfree has grown significantly. Posts about sugar addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and success stories. Less active than quit-alcohol or quit-smoking subs.

**App Demand Signals:** Low. There is no dominant "quit sugar" app. People use general habit trackers or food tracking apps. Occasional posts asking "is there an app for tracking sugar-free days?" but not frequently.

**Complaints:** No major app exists to complain about. The gap is the issue -- there's nothing purpose-built. But the question is whether a standalone "quit sugar" app is needed when calorie/macro trackers already track sugar intake.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Growing cultural awareness of sugar addiction, but the use case overlaps heavily with calorie trackers and habit trackers. Could work as a very niche product, or as a feature in a broader "quit bad habits" app.

---

## 27. COLD EXPOSURE / COLD PLUNGE

**Primary Subreddit:** r/BecomingTheIceMan (~10K members)
**Related:** r/coldshowers (~50K est.), r/Biohackers, r/wimhof

**Activity Level:** Moderate. r/BecomingTheIceMan is niche but active. Cold plunge discussions also appear across r/Biohackers and fitness subs. Growing trend driven by Andrew Huberman and Wim Hof.

**App Demand Signals:** Growing. Several new apps have launched: Brisk, IceBuddy, GoPolar, Monk, Plunge (from the hardware company), and Ultra Plunge. This is an active and growing app market. Users want session timing, temperature tracking, and health metric correlation.

**Complaints:** Many apps are tied to specific hardware (Plunge app). Generic timer apps don't track temperature or provide guidance. Some apps lack wearable integration.

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Small but growing niche with strong trend momentum (biohacking, longevity culture). Multiple new apps launching indicates market confidence. However, the addressable audience is still relatively small.

---

## 28. READING TRACKING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/books (~25M+ members), r/52book (~300K+ est.)
**Related:** r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook

**Activity Level:** Extremely high. r/books is one of the largest subs on Reddit. r/52book (read 52 books/year challenge) is very active with people sharing progress and asking for tracking recommendations.

**App Demand Signals:** Strong. Goodreads dominates but is widely HATED (owned by Amazon, barely updated in years, ugly UI, cluttered). The Storygraph is the rising challenger. Bookly, Literal, and PageBound are also discussed. "Goodreads alternative" is a frequently searched topic.

**Complaints About Existing Apps:** Goodreads has an outdated, clunky interface and Amazon ownership concerns. The Storygraph is good but still missing features. There's clear demand for a modern, beautiful reading tracker with good stats and social features.

**DEMAND RATING: HOT** -- Enormous community of readers actively looking for Goodreads alternatives. The Storygraph has proven the demand exists but hasn't fully captured the market. A well-designed reading tracker with strong stats/social features could break through.

---

## 29. MEAL PREP PLANNING

**Primary Subreddit:** r/MealPrepSunday (~5.6M members)
**Related:** r/EatCheapAndHealthy (~4M+), r/cooking (~25M+)

**Activity Level:** Very high. r/MealPrepSunday is a massive community with daily posts showing meal prep results, asking for recipes, and discussing planning strategies.

**App Demand Signals:** Moderate. Mealime, Paprika, Plan to Eat, AnyList, and Samsung Food are discussed. People ask for meal planning apps but many just use Pinterest, saved recipes, and grocery lists. The "app fatigue" is real -- people have tried and abandoned meal planning apps.

**Complaints:** Most meal planning apps have poor recipe import (broken URL parsers). Subscription pricing for basic features. Grocery list integration is often clunky. Many apps focus on recipes but not on the actual PLANNING (portioning, scheduling, batch cooking).

**DEMAND RATING: WARM** -- Large community but moderate app demand. People who meal prep tend to develop their own systems. The opportunity is in solving the actual friction (recipe scaling, grocery list automation, batch cooking schedules) rather than just collecting recipes.

---

## 30. DAILY LIFE RATING / LIFE SCORE

**Primary Subreddit:** No dedicated subreddit exists.
**Related:** r/quantifiedself (~60K est.), r/selfimprovement, r/Journaling

**Activity Level:** Very low as a standalone topic. "Rate my day" discussions are extremely rare. r/quantifiedself discusses broad self-tracking but "life scoring" is niche within that niche.

**App Demand Signals:** Very low. Rate My Day apps exist (small, indie) but are not widely discussed. Lifesum has a "Life Score" feature but it's a nutrition app. Daylio's mood tracking is the closest mainstream equivalent. No one on Reddit is asking for a "life score app."

**Complaints:** N/A -- not enough demand to generate complaints.

**DEMAND RATING: COLD** -- No community, no demand signal, no clear user need. This is a solution looking for a problem. Could be a feature inside a journaling or mood tracking app, not a standalone product.

---

| 27 | Cold Exposure / Cold Plunge | r/BecomingTheIceMan | ~10K | Trendy, new apps launching. Small but growing niche. |
| 29 | Meal Prep Planning | r/MealPrepSunday | ~5.6M | Large community but moderate app demand. Users build own systems. |

## COLD (Minimal demand, no dedicated community, or solution looking for a problem)
| # | Niche | Primary Sub | Members | Key Issue |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| 7 | Morning Routines | r/getdisciplined (general) | N/A standalone | No dedicated community. Just use habit trackers. |

## TOP 5 OPPORTUNITIES (Factoring in demand, gap in market, and feasibility)

1. **Intermittent Fasting (#6)** -- Existing top apps are HATED (scam billing). A trustworthy, fairly priced fasting timer could steal massive market share.

2. **Simple Calorie & Protein Tracking (#15)** -- MyFitnessPal's disastrous updates + 4.5M-member Reddit audience begging for simplicity = huge opening.

3. **Quit Weed (#11)** -- 300K+ member community, cannabis-specific withdrawal tracking underserved, growing cultural relevance, no dominant app.

4. **Quit Drinking / Sobriety (#2)** -- Massive emotional community, existing apps have subscription fatigue, simple day counter with clean UX wins.

5. **NoFap / Quit Porn (#3)** -- 1.2M members, intense engagement, no dominant non-preachy app, high retention potential due to emotional stakes.
